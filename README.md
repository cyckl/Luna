# What is Luna?
Luna is a Firefox addon meant to parody TOR / VPN services. Initially just meant for an unrelated English project, keep in mind that this addon isn't meant to accomplish anything, just look semi-realistic.

## Installing the addon
1. Download the addon from the releases page using Firefox 53 or higher
2. Allow the installation from Github

## Optional
* Set your Firefox theme to Compact Dark
* Clone the repository and set the included html file as the homepage.

## Sidenotes
